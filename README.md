# react-github-app
My First React Js application for showing popular repositories in github for a particular language and to compare ranking of two github users ( based on stars and follower counts)

## Popular tab : Shows popular repos based on language

![Popular tab screenShot](./popular.jpg?raw=true "Popular Repos")

## Battle tab : Compare ranking of two github users

![Ranking tab screenShot](./rank.jpg?raw=true "Calculate Rank")

Created based on React Learning Courses provided by @tylermcginnis
